      Who am I?
    </h1>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Seems a bit deep to start out with. A very open-ended, existential question.
      Anyway - as it is the first post - I figured that an introduction of myself would be the best place to start.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Most people who will read this blog will know who I am, what I've done in the past, and how it's gotten me
      to where I am now. But for those who don't - here goes.

      I've always been interested in technology and computers. I remember the first ever family computer we had - a
      Hewlett Packard desktop that ran Windows XP. It was too slow to do anything other than watch YouTube videos on,
      but I can remember being fascinated by it - and the internet in general. The fact that someone on the other side of the world
      can upload a video, or create a website, and I can see it on my computer was (and still is) cool to me.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      This obsession with the internet, mostly YouTube, led me down the path of wanting to become a YouTuber. Which kid
      in the mid-2010s didn't want to be a YouTuber? As expected, that channel went nowhere, and was quickly deleted. I stopped
      making videos, but my interest in technology and the internet never waned.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      We're now up to around 2013-2014 ish. I was in Year 3 (7-8 years old) and had moved to a different school. The primary school
      in my village was not the greatest, and my mum decided it would be better for my education if I were to go to a better school
      6 miles away. The fact that I had very little friends in my village as a result of this move led me to spend more time on the
      computer, and (combined with a school Scratch club) led me to start being interested in programming, and a methodical way of
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      With my mum working full-time, I used to go to an after-school club, for kids whose parents worked late or couldn't pick them up.
      The school pretty much let the kids do what they wanted within reason, and I would spend most of my time on the laptops, making
      games using Scratch. I never strayed beyond the nice visual UI of Scratch, but I think that whole experience of making games
      was what got me into programming. I can vividly remember trying to make a Pokemon game - with the animated sprites and everything -
      for about 3 months. I never finished it, as I would always keep restarting it. Some things never change.
    </p>
    <div class="mb-8">
      It was around 2016 that I thought I would try and venture a bit further than Scratch. Like most kids, I wanted to make games. Who didn't?
      I didn't know <i>anything</i> about programming. I probably searched something like "code online" or something, and managed to stumble across
      some sort of JavaScript tutorial, with a built-in IDE. I managed to run an <pre class="text-sm inline">alert("Hello!")</pre> and was super excited. I then didn't know what
      an IDE was, and didn't code anything <i>properly</i> until ~2017-2018. I can say though, that I wrote my first lines of code at 9 years old. Can I put that on my CV?

      I can also remember trying to write Lua (subtle foreshadowing) for a Roblox game I wanted to make. I wouldn't have been much older than 10 at the time,
      and I remember working through some Lua tutorial book, and I couldn't work out what the % operator (modulus) did. I was 10 - give me a fucking break! I
      was obviously not a resilient kid.
